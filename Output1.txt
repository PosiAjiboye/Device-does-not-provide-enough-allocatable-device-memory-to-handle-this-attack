# -Not-enough-allocatable-device-memory-for-this-attack.

I'm getting this error when trying to load an MD5 hash into memory and around 10k words from my library
My OCL device is a 750Ti with 2G VRAM.

As it works with smaller files, I can, of course, split the file and script hashcat to iterate through them, but would't be better if HC could handle this scenarios by itself? I don't thinl it's that uncommon.

Here's the complete output and version:

ATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) backend kernels selected.
Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.
